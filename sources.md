## Assistance from ChatGPT

The following sections of this project were created or refined based on guidance and prompts provided by ChatGPT:

### Key Prompts Used

1. **Project Structure and Multi-Page Setup**
   - **Prompt**: "I have a project with multiple Python files and I want to organize the main file to manage navigation between pages. Can you guide me on structuring the project with multiple pages in Streamlit?"
   - **Response**: ChatGPT provided guidance on organizing the project into separate modules (`app.py`, `audio_recorder.py`, `category_selection.py`, `results.py`) and setting up a navigation system with Streamlit.

2. **Audio Recording Setup**
   - **Prompt**: "The program needs to allow audio recording on one page. Can you show me how to integrate an audio recorder in Streamlit and save the recorded audio for analysis?"
   - **Response**: ChatGPT suggested using the `audiorecorder` library to enable in-app audio recording, along with installation instructions and setup details.

3. **Sentiment Analysis and OpenAI API Usage**
   - **Prompt**: "Can you help me create a function that uses the OpenAI API to analyze customer feedback? I need to get structured feedback analysis and sentiment scores for different categories."
   - **Response**: ChatGPT provided a structured prompt for using OpenAI's API to analyze text data, including sentiment scoring by category and general sentiment scores.

4. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - **Prompt**: "I want to make the final page look like a McKinsey-style presentation with clear visual separation for each category and a professional design. Any ideas on how to style it with Streamlit and add a sentiment score graph?"
   - **Response**: ChatGPT offered advice on adding a bar chart for sentiment scores, customizing section layouts with colors and borders, and aligning fonts and styles for a more polished look.

5. **User Guide and Documentation**
   - **Prompt**: "Can you help me write a user guide for this project that includes installation instructions and tips for first-time users? Also, mention the need for ffmpeg and Whisper model download."
   - **Response**: ChatGPT provided a complete user guide template, detailing installation steps, program usage, and additional dependencies, which was then saved as `USER_GUIDE.md`.

6. **Sources File**
   - **Prompt**: "Can you create a sources file that includes a reference to ChatGPT with some of the essential prompts used in this project?"
   - **Response**: ChatGPT provided this `SOURCES.md` template, listing the prompts and contributions made throughout the project.
